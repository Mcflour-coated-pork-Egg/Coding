Find the Losers of the Circular Game    Easy 2682.
In brief, n denotes the number of people, k denotes step.
Everyone passes the ball when received it, and every pass would add k step, the game ends when one received twice.
It means, from 0-index start. The 0-index passes the ball two (0+k)%n, and the (0+k)%n-index would pass the ball to ((0+k)%n+2*k)%n, till end.

Case 1:Too late, simply simulate.

Code:  
                            class Solution {
                            public:
                                vector<int> circularGameLosers(int n, int k) {
                                    vector<int> rece(n,0);
                                    int i=0;
                                    int t=1;
